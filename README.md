## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

**To do this project, a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is encouraged.**

## The project

This project is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

I used the JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as [React](https://reactjs.org). I also have complete control over which packages to use for making HTTP requests and styling my project..

My users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## Where to find everything

My task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

In this project, you will find mobile and desktop designs in light and dark mode color schemes for both pages.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

There are no assets for this project, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building my project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share my code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure my repository to publish my code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a project as you can share the URL for my project with my repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure my content with HTML. Writing my HTML first can help focus my attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for my project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying my project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host my project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Here is an expected image of the final project
